## **Does Whoer IP Provide DNS and WebRTC Leak Testing?**

Introduction:
In the realm of online security and privacy, DNS and WebRTC leaks can pose significant risks to users. Whoer IP, a powerful tool, offers comprehensive DNS and WebRTC leak testing to identify and address these vulnerabilities. In this article, we will explore the capabilities of Whoer IP in providing DNS and WebRTC leak testing and how it contributes to enhancing online security.

### **Understanding DNS and WebRTC Leaks**

DNS (Domain Name System) and WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) leaks can occur when sensitive information, such as IP addresses, is unintentionally exposed during internet browsing. DNS leaks occur when the DNS requests made by a user's device are sent outside of the encrypted tunnel, potentially revealing their real IP address. WebRTC leaks, on the other hand, can expose a user's IP address and local network details through web communication protocols.
